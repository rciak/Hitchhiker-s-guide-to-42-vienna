# Hitchhiker-s-guide-to-42-vienna

***Preliminary remark:*** This is evolving stuff

This repo shall help new students to get started
at 42 vienna more easily. Currently it focuses
on two aspects:

* **After Workshop Downloads**:
  In the folder `workshops` you can look
  if all or some of the material used in a
  workshop has been shared. (***!!! NO VERY BIG FILES like e.g. Videos PLEASE !!!***)
  For an overview have a look at
  `workshops/README_WORKSHOPS.md` please.

* **Collecting useful informations**:
  The accompanying github [wiki][corresp-wiki]
  is an experimental try to collect and share some notes (*not related* to workshops) that are hopefully usefull when starting at 42 Vienna.

**Volonteers are welcome:**
  If you would like to contribute: Just find me (reciak) in the clusters
  and I can give you write access to the repo.
  (Only make sure please, to ***never add big files*** like videos directly on this repo but rather put them at another location in the internet and just give a link to that location here.)
