# Pattern rules 1

* *Tell story:* We now go back in the past to a time when cats and dogs
  cats still spoke the same laguage.
  At this time there lived a group called the pirate copy cats,
  best known for their infamuous leader *pirate cat* remembered by the old
  as CC (copy cat) before turning to piracy...

* `make pcc_obj/work_1.miau`, ...

* --> Pirate cat annoyed: Can't I do this better than adding a new rule
  for essentially the same task each time?
* Replace the three individual rules (uncomment) by the pattern rule...  
  --> Does the same job.
